Mongoose is and ODM library : Object Document Mapping Library
User.get()
User.findByID()
Blog.deleteOne()

The mongodDB library is clunky and verbose

We will make schemas and models
Schemas are first
schemas describe what data types it will have

Blog schema:
title: string , required
snippet: string , required
body: string , required
uniaue id: number

then we make a model based off of the schema

1. npm install mongoose
