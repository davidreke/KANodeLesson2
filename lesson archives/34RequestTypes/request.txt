Get Requests - get a resource
Post - Create new data
Delete - Deletes data
Put - update exisiting data

localhost:3000/blog is a get request

localhost:3000/blogs - create a new blog needs a post request

localhost:3000/blogs/:id - make a route item and get request

localhost:3000/blogs/:id - make a delete request

we're not going to use the put request in this application
